    <p>A vaction is when you take a trip to some {{adjective1}} place with
      your {{adjective2}} family. Usually you got to some place that is near
      a/an {{noun1}} or up on a/an {{noun2}}. A good vaction place is one where
      you can ride {{pNoun1}} or play {{game}} or go to hunting for {{pNoun2}}.
      I like to spend my time {{verb1}} or {{verb2}}. When parents go on
      vaction, they spend their time eating three {{pNoun3}} a day, and fathers
      go play golf, and mothers sit around {{verb3}}. Last summer, my little
      brother fell in a/an {{noun3}} and got poison {{plant}} all over his
      {{bodyPart}}. My family is going to go to (the) {{place}}, and I will
      practice {{verb4}}. Parents need vactions more than kids because
      parents are always very {{adjective3}} and because they have to work
      {{number}} hours every day all year making enough {{pNoun4}} to pay
      for the vacation.
